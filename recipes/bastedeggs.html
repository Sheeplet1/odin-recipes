            A basted egg is somewhere between a sunny side up fried egg and a 
            poached egg. Basted eggs are fried on the bottom and steamed on 
            top. They look similar to sunny side up eggs, but the yolk is 
            slightly more set.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat</li>
            <li>Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites 
                have almost set, about 1 minute
            </li>
            <li>
                Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat 
                to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, yolks are 
                still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more 
                minutes
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with 
                pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.
