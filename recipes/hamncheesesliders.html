        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1.5 Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoons poppy seeds</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried minced onion</li>
            <li>24 mini sandwich rolls</li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced cooked deli ham</li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced Swiss cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> 
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 
                9x13-inch baking dish. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Mix butter, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, poppy seeds, and dried onion in a bowl. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Separate the tops from the bottoms of the rolls; arrange the 
                bottom pieces in a layer in the prepared baking dish. Layer 
                about 1/2 of the ham onto the rolls; add a layer of Swiss 
                cheese and top with remaining ham slices. Place the tops of 
                the rolls onto the sandwiches. Pour mustard mixture evenly 
                over the rolls. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until the rolls are lightly browned 
                and the cheese has melted, about 20 minutes. Slice into 
                individual rolls through the ham and cheese layers to serve.
